# Preface {-}

Welcome to this project of CIRCE e.V. - Collaboration for Research on Conscious Experiences.
We are a collective of researchers who aim to promote research on Altered States of Consciousness (ASC). In this open book project, we gather information on questionnaire tools to assess subjective experiences during ASCs. Currently, we have set it up as a bookdwon (gitbook), as this document will undergo continous updates. We plan to supplement usable versions of the questionnaires and helpful analysis tools. This might include printable PDFs of the questionnaires and digital versions (e.g. implementations in different programming languages), as well as analysis tools (e.g. Excel sheets).

If you are interested in contributeíng to this collection, you can get in touch with the CIRCE team - in particular with Dr. Timo T. Schmidt who is currently the main responsible person for this collection.

This collection is published under CC-BY 4.0

Please note: This is book is work in progress - we are keeping a ToDo List at the end of this book in which we list the next planed improvements.


# Acknowledgements  {-}

The information which made it into this book were collected over multiple years and many people contributed in different ways. Within two study projects in 2017-18 within teaching activities in the MSc program Cognitive Science at the Institute for Cognitive Science at the University of Osnabrück inital information on questionnaires was collected. These study projects were led by Dr. Timo Torsten Schmidt together with Dr. Axel Kohler and Dr. Uwe Friese. After completion of these study projects, several students from different institutions contributed to the collection within internships, lab rotations and similar research related activities. 

It was initially planned to publish an overview article and a corresponding manuscript was submitted to a journal. The editor of the journal advised to find a different format for publication and we agree that the accumulated collection of questionnaires (+corresponding background information) will be better accessible in a fully openly access format, which can better being kept up-to-date.

We would like to thank and acknowledge the important contributions of the following people (some of them were planned as authors on the article, which was then converted into the collection at hand): Katharina Dworatzyk, Ada Drochner, Michal Ljubljanac, Artur Czeszumski, Chiara Carrera, Aliona Cerednicenco, Aalia Nosheen, Philipp Kuhnke, Eelke de Vries, Hendrik Berkemeyer, Renato Garita Figueiredo, Nisha Jagannathan, J Jang, A Kesfhava, J Schott, O Vakhovska, MC Vargas Rivero, Ann Xavier (We hope that we did not forget anyone - otherwise please let us know).


Further, we would like to thank the following researchers for providing us with furhter information, discussion and feedback on this collection: Maja Maurer, Rick Strassman, Robin Carhart-Harris, Roland J Pekala, Eric Studerus, Frederick Barrett.
