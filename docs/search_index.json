If you notice any mistakes, please send an e-mail to Timo Torsten Schmidt: timo.t.schmidt at fu-berlin.de Multiple questionnaires have been developed to quantify the phenomenology of ASCs. Here, we provide an overview on available psychometric tools, their conceptual background and construction, and validation. Some questionnaires were designed to cover a broad range of different experiences (e.g. the Altered States of Consciousness Rating scale), others are designed to assess specific ASC phenomena (e.g. the Watts Connectedness Scale), and others were designed to assess the phenomena induced by a specific consciousness modifying technique (CMT). Based on their scope and on and prevalence in previous research, we aim to provide aid to decide which questionnaire can be best for a specific study. We discuss the tools in approximate order of prevalence/popularity. Table 1 gives an overview of the questionnaires in this collection, including some of their basic properties and key references. The most recent (and recommended version) is marked in bold. We included where currently new versions are under development.

The ASC-R has become the most frequently used psychometric tools in the assessment of ASC phenomena. The development of the scale followed the assumption that ASCs have a common core that is independent of the particular induction method (ethiology-independent dimensions of altered states). Therefore, in contrast to other instruments, the ASC-R is supposed to investigate characteristics of ASCs that are invariant across various methods to induce ASCs, including both pharmacological (e.g., psilocybin, ketamine, DMT, MDMA) and non-pharmacological induction methods (e.g., sensory deprivation, hypnosis, autogenic training). However, it is noticeable in the item selection, that the original authors had a research focus on the effects of psychedelics. Over the course of more than 30 years, the questionnaire underwent several refinements. Due to a lack of systematic curation, there is currently different versions in use and confusion about how to analyze them and present results. To support future research we summarize the history of the questionnaire with its different versions and point to unfortunate ambiguities in how data is currently reported. 2.1 APZ The name APZ is based on the original German name: Abnorme Psychische Zustände (abnormal mental states). An initial item collection was based on several self-assessment questionnaires on ASCs, and psychiatric rating scales, which resulted in a 158-item questionnaire version. In a series of experiments, which included data from variable induction methods, as well as factor and cluster analyses, the item pool was reduced to 72. These items comprise three common dimensions of ASC experiences: Oceanic Boundlessness (OBN), which measuring positive symptoms of dissolution of boundaries between self and surroundings; Dread of Ego Dissolution (DED) measuring negative symptoms of dissolution of boundaries between self and surroundings, and Visionary Reconstruction (VRS) measuring perceptual changes and imagination (Dittrich, 1985). 2.2 OAV The name OAV uses the first letters of the German names of the three main dimensions of the APZ (Ozeanische Selbstentgrenzung (OSE = OBN); Angstvolle Ich-Auflösung (AIA = DED) und Visuelle Restrukturalisierung (VRS)). For the OAV version, the questionnaire was revised in terms of conceptualization, wording, and form in the scope of an unpublished master thesis (Bodmer, 1989). The most important modification was the replacement of the former dichotomous response format by visual analog scales to allow the assessment of the intensity of effects (Bodmer et al., 1994). 2.3 5D-ASC (or OAVAV) The common core dimensions OBN, DED and VRS were complemented by two additional empirically derived scales: Auditory Alterations (AUA) and Vigilance Reduction (VIR). These scales assess changes in auditory perception such as hallucinations and drowsiness or clouding of consciousness, respectively. As opposed to the former three, these additional dimensions are considered rather specific to certain induction methods (Dittrich et al., 2006, 2010), and their validation is not as good as the one of the main three dimensions (See below). The 5D-ASC version with 96-items that comprise 5 dimensions has become a standard tool for the assessment of effects of psychedelics (including clinical studies), and also a Handbook for the analysis is available (in German). For the analysis Mean scores of the items that belong to the corresponding dimension are calculated and expressed as percentage of maximum score (for convenience the original print version uses corresponding visual analog scales of 10cm length). Note: In some older publications one can find a sum score, instead of a mean percentage score, which causes problems for comparability as the dimensions contain different amounts of items. In the Altered States Database, such data has been converted (typically after confirmation from the authors of the accurate number of items). It is advised to report data, as percentage of maximum score. 2.4 11-ASC Several methodological shortcomings of the 5D-ASC construction motivated a reanalysis which revealed a new analysis scheme for a subset of 42 items of the ASC-R (Studerus et al., 2010). This analysis was based on only the 66 items belonging to the three main dimensions of the 5D-ASC (the original OAV dimensions). Re-examination of the factorial structure was based on psilocybin and ketamine data and revealed that an 11-factorial model is suitable to fit the data and increases scale homogeneity (Studerus et al., 2010). Corresponding scales were named as: (1) Experience of Unity, (2) Spiritual Experience, (3) Blissful State, (4) Insightfulness, (5) Disembodiment, (6) Impaired Control and Cognition, (7) Anxiety, (8) Complex Imagery, (9) Elementary Imagery, (10) Audio-Visual Synesthesia, and (11) Changed Meaning of Percepts. These eleven factors can be regarded as basic/elementary subscales of the three original scales, which describe rather high-order concepts. 2.5 Short Versions Within the Altered Xperience Project Citizen Science project (Schmidt et al. 2023) a 22-item version was applied. Items were selected based on the ‘items validation’ according to Studerus et al. This short version has not been validated, but the collected data is available on OSF and is open to be used for a validation (Go for it if you have time and let the authors know). To the best of our knowledge a team in the Netherlands is currently working on the validation of a even shorter version. 2.6 Important notes Note 1: Please note that the 11-factorial analysis scheme presented by Studerus et al. (2010) revealed 11 factors (!) and not 11 dimensions. Unfortunately, the original publication of the analysis scheme did not contain a suggestion for a new name, and multiple authors (including ourselves) started to name it “11D-ASC”. However, this is appears not appropriate and instead we suggest now to speak about the ASC-R to refer to the full questionnaire with 96-items, which can be analyzed according to the 5D-ASC or the 11-ASC analysis scheme. Note 2: Please note that the 11 factors of the 11-ASC can be assigned to the three main dimensions of the 5D-ASC. Unfortunately, some publications contain a wrong assignment of the 11 scales where the Disembodiment factor is assigned to DED (e.g. Vollenweider &amp; Kometer 2010). However, the items that comprise the Disembodiment factor are taken from OBN and should be assigned correspondingly (Compare how they are displayed e.g. in Hirschfeld &amp; Schmidt 2021 or Hirschfeld et al. 2023). Note 3: It should be noted that the three main dimensions of the 5D-ASC are calculated from the original set of 66 items. If only a 42-item version was applied, it is not possible to calculate the scores for OBN, DED or VUS. It is neither valid to take the mean score of the scales (mean of means), nor is it valid to take the mean score of all items belonging to the corresponding dimensions. Note 4: It is not clear to us what the situation with regards to Copyrights of the 5D-ASC is. The original publication states that the copyrights are with “PSIN PLUS Publicationes, 2006”. However, it appears that the corresponding publisher is highly limited in the responsiveness with regards to placing orders or issuing bills for license fees. Potentially the publisher does not exist anymore (We cannot find any traces online - If somebody has more information on this – please let us know and we are happy to make this information available here). 2.7 Validation, Translations, Adaptations and Future Developments In terms of quality criteria, the German 5D-ASC and its former versions were repeatedly assessed as reliable and valid instruments. The validation of the APZ revealed good results regarding internal consistency, test-retest reliability as well as convergent and discriminant validity (Dittrich, 1985; Dittrich et al., 1985). Assessments of internal consistency estimated by Hoyt (0.89 to 0.95) and test-retest correlation (0.75&lt;r&lt;0.82) suggest the OAV’s reliability (Bodmer, 1989). Internal consistency (estimated by Hoyt) was also good for the 5D-ASC’s additional scales: 0.88 (AUA) and 0.88 (VIR) (Dittrich et al., 2006, 2010). The proposed 11-factorial structure was assessed in a pooled data analysis of several experimental studies, which were however limited to pharmacological induction methods of ASCs. This evaluation indicates high reliability for all scales with a mean Cronbach’s alpha of 0.83. Correlation with the EWL-60-S (short form of the Adjective Word List) and the STAI-S (state version of the State-Trait-Anxiety Inventory) suggest convergent and discriminant validity of this scale (Studerus et al., 2010). Together with alternative reliability assessments, these results demonstrate its suitability as a reliable and valid psychometric tool for the assessment of subjective experiences occurring during ASCs. Originally developed in German, the Altered State of Consciousness Rating Scale was translated into English and several other languages (Studerus et al., 2012). Recent application in neuroimaging studies demonstrates its wide acceptance and significance for the scientific study of ASCs (e.g., (Carhart-Harris et al., 2016a)). However, this questionnaire is, except for its earlier version APZ, is to the best of our knowledge not validated in other languages than German. A adaption for the assessment of effects of Floating-REST has been reported and termed Experienced Deviation from the Normal State questionnaire (EDN) (Kjellgren et al., 2001). A current trend in the field is to develop short and ultra-short version of questionnaires to take less time in the assessment. A 22-item version was used in the Altered eXperience Project (Schmidt et al. 2023), and we have heard about current attempts to validate a 11-item version (personal communication - We will post updates as soon as we have more information). "],["phenomenology-of-consciousness-inventory-pci.html", "Chapter 3 Phenomenology of Consciousness Inventory (PCI) 3.1 Validation, Translations, Adaptations", " Chapter 3 Phenomenology of Consciousness Inventory (PCI) The Phenomenology of Consciousness Inventory (PCI) (Pekala, 1982, 1991) was developed in the context of an interdisciplinary approach that is described as empirical-phenomenological (Pekala, 1991). Most notably influenced by C. T. Tart’s (1975) conception of ASCs, it is hypothesized that different states are characterized by distinct structures and patterns of subjective experiences (Pekala, 1991). The subjective experience of a certain state can be characterized based on phenomenologically well-defined dimensions which can be quantified in terms of their intensity. The resulting pattern is assumed to be typical of a specific induction method and can be observed consistently whenever this method is applied. The PCI is a self-report questionnaire that is completed in retrospect, after acute ASC effects have subsided. Originating from three previous versions, the Phenomenology of Consciousness Questionnaire (PCQ), the (Abbreviated) Dimensions of Consciousness Questionnaire ((A)DCQ), and the Pre-PCI, the most recent version of the PCI is available in two different versions. Form 1 and Form 2 contain the same number of items, which are, however, arranged in a different order. The items of the PCI are presented as two opposing statements located on the two poles of a 7-point Likert scale. The statements address 12 major dimensions, five being further subdivided into more specific sub-dimensions: (1) Altered State of Awareness, (2) Altered Experience (Altered Body Image, Altered Time Sense, Altered Perception, Altered Meaning), (3) Volitional Control, (4) Self-awareness, (5) Rationality, (6) Internal Dialogue, (7) Positive Affect (Joy, Sexual Excitement, Love), (8) Negative Affect (Anger, Sadness, Fear), (9) Imagery (Amount, Vividness), (10) Attention (Direction, Absorption), (11) Memory and (12) Arousal. Corresponding scales were constructed on the basis of several cluster and factor analyses. 3.1 Validation, Translations, Adaptations Several studies were conducted in order to evaluate the PCI’s quality in terms of validity and reliability. Assessments of the English PCI under different stimulus conditions (Pekala, 1991) demonstrate good overall internal consistency with an average Cronbach’s alpha ranging from of 0.75 to 0.83 for major dimensions. Evidence for the PCI’s good validity is given by the comparison with the Dimensions of Attention Questionnaire (DAQ) (0.69&lt; r &lt;0.78) (Pekala, 1991) and the prediction of hypnotic susceptibility as measured with the Harvard Group Scale of Hypnotic Susceptibility (HGSHS) on the basis of the PCI’s major dimensions; e.g. significant correlation (r=0.64, p&lt;0.05) of predicted and actual HGSHS scores using the regression coefficients from a previous study (Pekala, 1995). In the scope of a diploma thesis Rux (2002) evaluated the German version of the PCI. The reliability assessment yielded a medium internal consistency for all scales with alpha coefficients being lowest for Love (0.37) and highest for Altered State of Internal Dialogue (0.86) and an average alpha of 0.69. The original version of the PCI was translated from English into German by Ott and subsequently authorized by Pekala (Rux, 2002). An Excel sheet, available from the questionnaire’s author upon request, allows for an automatic computation of item and factor scores. In summary, this broad questionnaire allows for a quite fine-grained assessment due to its 12 major and 14 minor scales. However, it should be considered that the PCI was designed with a focus on hypnosis and has primarily been applied in studies investigating effects of hypnosis, meditation, and related induction methods like shamanic-journeying or stress management techniques. Its administration in pharmacological studies is rather rare. "],["addiction-research-center-inventory-arci.html", "Chapter 4 Addiction Research Center Inventory (ARCI) 4.1 Validation, Translations, Adaptations", " Chapter 4 Addiction Research Center Inventory (ARCI) The ARCI has been developed by Haertzen et al. (1963) in the attempt to measure a broad range of physical, emotive, and cognitive effects of different drugs and subjective experiences related to personality and psychiatric disorders (Haertzen et al., 1963; Haertzen and Hickey, 1987). Items were derived from responses of opiate addicts made in a sentence completion task during baseline, and various drug states and supplemented with items from personality inventories (Haertzen et al., 1963; Haertzen, 1974). A pool of 3300 statements was reduced to a set of 550 true-false items (ARCI long-form) and assigned to five categories: (1) general information, (2) interest and drives, (3) sensation and perception, (4) bodily symptoms and processes, and (5) feelings and attitudes (Haertzen, 1974). Items are mainly phrased in present tense in order to refer to an acute state (Haertzen et al., 1963). Thirty additional items, repeating prior statements in the same or logically opposite form, were included to test for cooperation or carelessness (Haertzen and Hickey, 1987). To diagnostically differentiate between states, Haertzen and colleagues developed multiple scales to dissociate specific drug intoxications as well as psychiatric conditions (Hill et al., 1963a, 1963b; Haertzen, 1974). A final 38-scales scoring system for the 550-item long form of the ARCI was established (Haertzen, 1974). Amon those various empirical scales were derived with a focus on state-specific effects (Haertzen, 1974). As the ARCI was not necessarily intended to be applied in its entirety, many studies used only some scales relevant to their specific hypotheses (e.g. (Jasinski et al., 1971)). The most established short form developed by Martin et al. (1971) consists of 49 items that are clustered into five group variability scales: the Benzedrine scale (BG), the Lysergic Acid Diethylamide scale (LSD), the Morphine-Benzedrine and (MBG), and the Pentobarbital-Chlorpromazine-Alcohol scale (PCAG) of the ARCI long form supplemented with the empirically derived 11-item Amphetamine scale (A). Among the plurality of short forms is this the most commonly used questionnaire in current studies (e.g.(Griffiths et al., 2006; Schmid et al., 2015)). 4.1 Validation, Translations, Adaptations Reliability assessments in five sample populations (criminals, addicts, alcoholics, mentally ill patients, normal population) yielded Kuder-Richardson KR-20 scores for each of the 38 scales (Haertzen, 1970). As the internal consistency demonstrated a large range from 0.06 (Marijuana scale in normal population) to 0.97 (Reactivity in alcoholic sample), the utility of some scales appears rather questionable. In addition, test-retest reliability was assessed (Haertzen, 1970). Several further studies evaluated the psychometric properties of the short form in different languages (Lamas et al., 1994; Arasteh et al., 1999; Riba et al., 2001). Acceptable reliability coefficients are particularly obtained for the Spanish version. Both long and short form have been translated and validated from English into multiple languages: long form: German, French, Spanish, Swedish (Haertzen, 1974); short form: Spanish (Lamas et al., 1994; Arasteh et al., 1999), French (Warot et al., 1997). Through its availability in different languages, the ARCI was a common instrument to measure drug effects both in clinical settings and experimental research, e.g. including studies on ayahuasca (Riba et al., 2001). As the long form is very time-demanding, the short form (Martin et al., 1971) is more feasible. In particular, its Spanish translation (Lamas et al., 1994) found wide-spread application and has been assessed in terms of psychometric features. However, a recent exploratory factor analysis performed on data from 158 ayahuasca practitioners suggests a three-factor (Euphoria, Activation, Sedation) structure comprising only 18 of the 49 items (Bouso et al., 2016). Another limitation is the application of a dichotomous response format. The use of categorical responses instead of individual intensity ratings precludes any correlational analysis, which is, however, often required in experimental research to establish direct relations between the subjective experience and physiologic measures.
